## Potato Disease Classification
This project aims to classify potato leaves into three categories: Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy. We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to achieve this classification.

### Directory Structure
The dataset is organized into the following structure:

PlantVillage/
    ├── Potato___Early_blight/
    ├── Potato___healthy/
    ├── Potato___Late_blight/
Each directory contains images of potato leaves that belong to the respective category.

### Dataset
We use the PlantVillage dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle:

[Kaggle Dataset: Plant Village](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)


Model
The classification model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow. The model architecture is designed to effectively classify the images into the three categories based on the features extracted from the input images.


Future Work
Possible improvements and future work include:

- Experimenting with different model architectures.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
- Expanding the dataset with more images and additional classes.
